        <p>During the 70s and 80s, New Yorkers faced tough times and through those times they found themselves hopeless. A DJ by the name of DJ Kool Herc hosted a party that revolutionized the music industry. Soon DJs all around New York heard about Herc and decided to add on to his ideas. Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa began to throw parties as well and b-boys and b-girls began to dance to the break of the song. In the early 80s, filmmakers began to make movies and wanted to get the story of Hip-Hop out in the world. It all started in the Bronx.</p>
